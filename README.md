# Cloud Resume

This project involves creating an HTML-based resume styled with CSS and deploying it as a secure static website on Amazon S3, with a visitor counter implemented using JavaScript. Additionally, it requires setting up AWS services such as DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Lambda, all managed through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automated deployment, while documenting the experience in a blog post.
